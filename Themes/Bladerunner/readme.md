## Bladerunner's Theme

This is a simple theme I created for my friend Bladerunner to match his colorscheme.
Its dark-dark-gray with some dull-green flat widgets and cream text.

### Windows

Simply copy it to ```C:\Program Files\HexChat\etc\gtk-2.0``` or use it like you would any other gtkrc.

### Linux

Start hexchat overriding the GTK_RC_FILES or maybe the GTK2_RC_FILES environment variable.
Set it to the full path of the stored the gtkrc.
```GTK_RC_FILES=/home/knivey/.config/hexchat/gtkrc /usr/bin/hexchat```

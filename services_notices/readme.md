## Services Notices
This script is to change the behaviour of how hexchat handles notices.
On our irc network services have a hostmask matching *@services.* and the service bots aren't always in the same channel when they notice you. This script forces those notices to go to your active channel on that network instead of to a common channel shared with the service bot.
